## What Relist does
Relist connects to a sheet you have on Google Spreadsheet and renders it on a public webpage in a form of enriched list.\
Each row of the sheet becomes an item on the list and the app's template takes care of making the list look good and clear.\
Thanks to an additional spreadsheet, It's possible to configure which columns to consider and customise the way they are displayed.\
\
Relist is a general purpose tool aimed to make structured data accessible, easy to share and easy to filter.\
Most important: it doesn't require users to register or set up a web hosting.\
\
Possible use cases:
- Schools or gyms listing their courses or teachers.
- A group of collegues who created a list of the nearby restaurants.
- Collectionists showcasing their collectables.
- Feelancers sahring a list of their projects.
-  etc..

## Practical Example
Given the following spreadsheet:
|![image](https://github.com/dbertella/relist/assets/3997836/b31641da-a160-401f-8496-7899225dce37)|
|-|

And given the following configuration:
|![image](https://github.com/dbertella/relist/assets/3997836/a1ba733c-f13f-439b-869f-0a58efd2c30d)|
|-|

Relist would look like this:

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
